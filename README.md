# ADAttributeEditor
This is a simple command-line based script to modify an AD User's Manager or Title using the ms-active-directory library (https://github.com/zorn96/ms_active_directory)

Through a series of prompts, the program will guide the user through the steps needed to make the desired change.

# Areas for Improvement
* Implementation of selecting a user if multiple with the same name exist
* Querying for a user without the full and/or exact display name
* Potential for integration with file I/O to completely automate the changes
* Room for prompt formatting adjustments
